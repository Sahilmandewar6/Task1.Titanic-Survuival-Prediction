# Task1.Titanic-Survuival-Prediction

**Titanic Survival Prediction
Overview:
The Titanic Survival Prediction project is an analysis and prediction task that leverages machine learning to predict the likelihood of passengers surviving the tragic sinking of the RMS Titanic. This project uses a dataset containing information about passengers, such as their age, class, fare, and other features, to train a machine learning model for survival prediction.

Features:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore and analyze the Titanic dataset to gain insights into the demographics of passengers, survival rates, and key factors influencing survival.

Data Preprocessing: Cleanse and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and prepare the data for machine learning modeling.

Machine Learning Model: Develop a predictive model using machine learning algorithms to estimate the likelihood of survival for passengers based on their attributes.

Evaluation Metrics: Assess the performance of the machine learning model using relevant evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Interactive Dashboard: Utilize visualization tools like Power BI to create an interactive dashboard displaying key statistics, visualizations, and predictions.

Technologies Used:
Python for data preprocessing and machine learning model development.
Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis and model training.
Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn for data manipulation and machine learning.
 
GitHub for version control and collaboration.**
